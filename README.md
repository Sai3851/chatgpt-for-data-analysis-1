# Leveraging AI for Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project explores the use of AI-driven data analysis by leveraging ChatGPT for generating analytical insights while cross-checking results using Python code in Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab. The main objective is to evaluate how AI models can assist in data-driven decision-making while ensuring accuracy by executing the underlying Python code.

## Approach

### Data Collection & Preprocessing
Loaded dataset containing job postings and salary information.
Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, standardizing formats, and ensuring data integrity.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed feature distributions, correlations, and trends using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
Checked for outliers and inconsistencies in the salary_yearly column.
Identified important features impacting salary prediction.
### Model Training & Evaluation
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Trained Linear Regression and evaluated model performance using R² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Identified potential issues like data leakage when obtaining an unusually high R² score (1.00).
Investigated model accuracy using feature correlation analysis.
### Cross-Validation Using AI & Code Execution
Direct responses from ChatGPT were compared with the results obtained from executing Python code.
AI-driven insights were validated by manually running code in Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook.
Ensured that all analytical steps could be replicated and verified.
